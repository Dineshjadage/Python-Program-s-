# Opening .py Files with IDLE

## Introduction
This guide explains how to open and run `.py` (Python) files using IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment), which comes with Python.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
- IDLE comes bundled with Python, so installing Python automatically installs IDLE.

## Steps to Open .py Files with IDLE

### Method 1: Open IDLE and Load the File
1. Open IDLE:
   - Windows: Search for "IDLE" in the Start Menu and open it.
   - macOS/Linux: Run `idle` in the terminal.
2. Click on `File` > `Open...`.
3. Select the `.py` file you want to open.
4. The file will open in a new window for editing and execution.

### Method 2: Open .py File Directly with IDLE
1. Locate the `.py` file on your computer.
2. Right-click on the file and select **Open With**.
3. Choose **IDLE (Python GUI)**.
4. The script will open in an IDLE editor window.

### Method 3: Open .py File from Command Line
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   python -m idlelib <your_script.py>
   ```
   Replace `<your_script.py>` with the path to your Python script.

## Running the Script in IDLE
- To run the script, press `F5` or go to `Run` > `Run Module`.
- Any output will appear in the IDLE Shell window.

## Additional Notes
- If IDLE does not appear in the **Open With** options, browse for the IDLE executable in your Python installation directory.
- Ensure that `.py` files are associated with Python if double-clicking does not open them in IDLE.

## Troubleshooting
- If IDLE does not open, try reinstalling Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
- Ensure your system PATH includes the Python installation directory.
